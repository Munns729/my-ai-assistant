# app.py - Main Application File for AI Knowledge Assistant
# This file creates a web server that handles all the web pages and user interactions

# Flask: The web framework that creates our website
# request: Gets data from forms when users submit them
# render_template: Shows HTML pages to users
# redirect: Sends users to different pages automatically
# url_for: Creates links to other pages safely
# flash: Shows temporary messages like "Success!" or "Error!"

from dotenv import load_dotenv  # Safely reads our .env file where we store secret keys

import openai  # The library that talks to OpenAI's GPT models

from datetime import datetime  # Gets current date and time for timestamps

# Import our custom functions from other files we'll create
from database import init_database, save_insight, get_all_insights, search_insights, get_insight_by_id
# init_database: Sets up our database tables
# save_insight: Saves new insights to database
# get_all_insights: Gets all saved insights from database
# search_insights: Searches through insights
# get_insight_by_id: Gets a specific insight by its ID

from insights import extract_insights_from_text, get_video_info
# extract_insights_from_text: Sends content to AI and gets back insights
# get_video_info: Gets YouTube video details (we'll use this later)

    # host='127.0.0.1': Only accessible from this computer (localhost)
    # port=5000: The server runs on port 5000 (so URL is http://127.0.0.1:5000)

# === HOW THIS ALL WORKS TOGETHER ===
#
# 1. User visits http://127.0.0.1:5000 â†’ home() function runs â†’ shows main page
# 2. User pastes content and clicks submit â†’ analyze_content() runs â†’ AI analyzes â†’ saves to DB
# 3. User clicks "View Insights" â†’ view_all_insights() runs â†’ shows all saved insights
# 4. User clicks on specific insight â†’ view_insight() runs â†’ shows detailed view
# 5. User searches for something â†’ search() runs â†’ finds and shows matching insights
#
# Each function is like a different "page" or "action" on your website!

# === WHAT YOU'LL SEE WHEN RUNNING ===
#
# In terminal: 
# * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
# * Debug mode: on
#
# In browser:
# - Main page with form to paste content
# - After submitting: Success message and your AI insights!
# - Navigation to see all your insights
# - Search functionality to find specific topics
#
# This creates a complete web application for your personal AI knowledge assistant!
